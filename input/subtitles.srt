1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 All of your body language is important,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,480
 but in this video, we're going to concentrate on the face.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,040
 In 2014, the University of Glasgow concluded

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,080
 that there are 42 muscles in the human face.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,679
 That's 42 opportunities you have to help convey your message.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,160
 Unfortunately, not everyone activates all the muscles

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,359
 in their face, and the result of that

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,719
 is that your message can end up falling a little flat.

9
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,919
 Here's a comparison to show you what I mean.

10
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,960
 There's a big storm coming in this Friday,

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,719
 which will definitely impact your weekend plans,

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,640
 but the forecast next week is looking clear for holiday travel.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,679
 There's a big storm coming in this weekend,

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,399
 which will definitely impact your holiday plans,

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,079
 but the forecast next week is looking clear for holiday travel.

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,599
 Now, in both examples, the energy in my voice was similar.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
 However, you'll notice that in the second example,

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,200
 I was really using a lot more of my facial muscles.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,079
 In addition, I was also smiling more.

20
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,159
 Smiling is a great way to instantly add energy to your face.

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,400
 Now, with the weather forecast,

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
 we're not always smiling about what we have to talk about,

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,240
 but when you do have the opportunity,

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,840
 don't forget to use your smile.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
 Now, if you need help, activating the muscles in your face.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,359
 Here's a simple exercise that actors often use.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,719
 It's called lemon face, lion face.

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,159
 And all you do is contort your face

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
 so that you act like you just bit into a very sour lemon

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,959
 and then quickly transform your face into a roaring lion.

31
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,719
 It goes a little something like this.

32
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,400
 Repeat that a few times.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,159
 Yes, it seems a little goofy,

34
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,039
 but it's a great way to warm up those facial muscles.
